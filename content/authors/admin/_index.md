I am a 1st-year PhD student at University of California, Santa Cruz, supervised by [Prof. Cihang Xie](https://cihangxie.github.io/). Before this, I received my Master's degree at Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Science, and Bachelor's degree at Central South University. I have also spent wonderful times at Megvii.

My research interest lies in the intersection of machine learning and copmuter vision, with specific interest in robustness and generalizability of deep learning models.
